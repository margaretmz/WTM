# Manual install
You have found the manual installation instructions. If you'd prefer an easier way, please consider installing locally or in the Cloud using Docker, as described in the [Readme](../README.md). If you're sure you want to install manually, here's a list of libraries you'll need. Note: because this is a short workshop, the instructors may not have time to help you debug installation issues that may arise. This approach is not supported. 

For reference, here's the [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) we used to build the container.

Here are the libraries you'll need:

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). On Mac OSX and Ubuntu, we recommend using a **virtualenv** based installation, as described on the installation page.

* [Magenta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/image_stylization). Also download the pre-trained style transfer models (helpfully provided) on this page.

* [Fast Style Transfer](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer). Also download the pre-trained models.

* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

### Finished installing?
Great! Preview the [exercise](exercises.md) instructions.
